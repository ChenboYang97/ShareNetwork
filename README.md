## Reflection 
This was a side project built during my second year at the University of Southern California. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with the web development workflow.  
   
### Technologies implemented
Backend:
* Goland standard library for backend MVC architecture  
* Elasticsearch for search engine and database for text resources
* Google Cloud Storage Bucket for images and videos
* JWT for token based authentication

Frontend:
* React components for the frontend function
* React router v4 for routing
